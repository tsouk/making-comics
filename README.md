Notes and resources on the process of making comics

## Finished not perfect
This is great advice. Your work has to be finished, not perfect. Perfectionism is used as a good character trait sometimes, wrongly. It is a bad character trait. It is is reason people do not start working on something, or don't go back to work on something, because they cannot bear it being not perfect. Fernando Pessoa wrote: “We worship perfection because we can't have it; if we had it, we would reject it. Perfection is inhuman, because humanity is imperfect.”
“I'm astounded whenever I finish something. Astounded and distressed. My perfectionist instinct should inhibit me from finishing: it should inhibit me from even beginning. But I get distracted and start doing something. What I achieve is not the product of an act of my will but of my will's surrender. I begin because I don't have the strength to think; I finish because I don't have the courage to quit. This book is my cowardice.”

Learn from this.

But,
...also have a bar. A bar under which your work will not fall. Own it. Don't change whenever you feel uncomfortable.

In the end, don't spend 1 day on a whole page and then 3 more days drawing the same nose over and over. Be a coward like Fernando and surrender to that imperfect nose.

- [Average number of words: ](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-number-of-actual-words-in-comic-books-or-graphic-novels)
_210 words per page. If you have 6 panels, stick to a maximum of 35 words per panel. If you have 9 panels, it’s 20–25 words. And if a single word balloon has more than 25 words in it, it is going to look too big._ [from here](http://www.comicscube.com/2012/07/the-craft-interview-with-alan-moore-by.html)
