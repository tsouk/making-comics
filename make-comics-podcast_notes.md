## Feedback:
Someone who understands comics.
Creator's workshop, by Andy Schmidt.
Ripping you a new one is uncool. You need critique that is making you better, that helps. Knowing what to dismiss and what to take to heart. "Here's why. Here's a suggestion." Not someone who will rewrite you're story. Good feedback will tell you what you are doing right. Usually people don't do that. This piece of dialogue, that page turn.
Decompressed storytelling?
Vs jam packed?
The person that breaks the rule had to know the rule so well, that can break the rule. Skilled craftsman.

## Networking:
Research before, for the right kind of publisher, etc. Dark Horse, Image, etc. Reach out to people in advance. Go up to them and say "I loved the Hulk, or something", cause they are all in a convention haze. The GOAL is to make contact, don't take mucho of their time, all for contact info. Immediately write down who you talked to. WRITE IT DOWN.
Make sure your contact info is in your comic. You might not get Marvel to print it, but it gives you a better chance to be remembered.
It's a business interaction.
(si, you need to shower dude)
If you have a good conversation with Brian Michael Bendis or something, ask him for the contacts of 3 other people that you should reach out to

## Script:
Warren Ellis post about what a comic book script is for. Comic book script is unique.
Instructions. Clear. He doesn't talk about people as his creative partner. So, your don't hide things in a murder mystery. For that.
It's a format for 2 audiences, your artist, and your end readers.
Some writes write all dialogue first, some interleave.
Camera direction- usually writes don't visualise how 6 panels with camera angles will look together. Good to let your artists choose. Let them be the expert. 6 panels. 9 panels has it's own thing. 7 is more digit than 8 or 9.

## Portfolio
variety, they want to know that if they give it to someone who had never read comics they will get it. Not the same angles all the time.

## Page Turns
The final panel has to ASK a question or suggest a question.

## Cons
Have a book. Test selling? Smaller con
Greek ταβερνα τραπεζομάντηλο χάρτινο.
Cycladic art, faces & idols, Piper.
Φλαρος, greek pottery.

## Acts
4-5 issues for a trade paperback
Say what it is about on issue 1
Character should be down in the dumps, darkest scariest place by the end of act 2.


## Self review:
Be confident of your work, be critical of your work VS be proud.
Be proud of all the work that you do, even if it is a miserable failure, artistically or financially, there is a virtue of doing.
What works well, what doesn't.
Understand what's working and what's not..

_"it's easy to break in to comics. You know what is difficult to break into? Medicine ( Engineering )"_
Brian Michael Bendis

## Publishing:
- How is it marketable
- How good the execution is
- does it fill a hole?
- The hook and the premise.


## Iland notes:
The organ pipes are only in the adult Io vox. Only normal brass to brass pipes in the young one.
Our high concept:
Miyazaki in Greece. Greek island.
Studio Ghibli in Greece.
Laputa on a Greek island. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Sky)

## Anis Mogjani idea:
Shake the Dust, but you or your face in (somehow), it starts with pictures of people he mentions and they gradually morph into your face in the last bit, on a curve. Send him that. Find morph face js libraries.
